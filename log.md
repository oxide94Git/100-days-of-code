# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, 2018 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp 'twitch api app' abandoned a month ago.
  Learned:
    1. jquery- a. append().
    2. css - a. padding,
             b. display: block;,
             c. background vs background color
    3. Git - a. git diff --staged
             b. github fork
             c. commit -m
             d. remote add origin
             e. remote -v
    4. javscript- a. forEach()
                  b. filter()

**Thoughts:** I struggled with css but have grabed a few properties now. I am mesmerized with the power of append(being able to write inline HTML) but not sure about it, obviously there is another way of doing it. I use to jumps around tutorials but mostly forget the concepts because i don't implement them, now i know, i need to write my own code everyday. sharing on social media is not that embarassing. i need to forgive myself, i need to accept i don't need to be genius.

**Task Remaining:** Display "offline", "Online" to the right

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
