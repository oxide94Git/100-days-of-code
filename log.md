# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, 2018 Sunday(Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp 'twitch api app' abandoned a month ago.
  Learned:
    1. jquery- a. append().
    2. css - a. padding,
             b. display: block;,
             c. background vs background color
    3. Git - a. git diff --staged
             b. github fork
             c. commit -m
             d. remote add origin
             e. remote -v
    4. javscript- a. forEach()
                  b. filter()

**Thoughts:** I struggled with css but have grabed a few properties now. I am mesmerized with the power of append(being able to write inline HTML) but not sure about it, obviously there is another way of doing it. I use to jumps around tutorials but mostly forget the concepts because i don't implement them, now i know, i need to write my own code everyday. sharing on social media is not that embarassing. i need to forgive myself, i need to accept i don't need to be genius.

**Task Remaining:** Display "offline", "Online" to the right

### Day 2: April 30, 2018 Monday (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: played around with bootstrap and css values but could not make selectors stick to the left.
##Learned:
    1. css- a. float: right;
            b. clear: right;
            c. cursor: pointer;
            d. overflow: hidden;
            e. max-width: 700px

**Thoughts**: waited for electricity whole night but it came after 14 hrs, it was off from 12:30pm to 2:30 pm 1'st may. i'am updating this on May 1, 2018 10:07 pm.

### Day 2: May 1, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added flter and selectors functionality to 'twtich Api app'.
##Learned:
  1. jquery- a. empty();
             b. on(event, callback);//calling pre-defined get callled imediately, call other functions inside callback.

**Thoughts** yes this is on the same day. people at #100DaysOfCode were really helpfull made some new connections on twitter, finally fighting my fear, socialising. i'm better implementing functionality than designs.
